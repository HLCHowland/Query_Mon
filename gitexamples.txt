Got to clone and clone the repository and stick wherever you want 
to work on it from.

$git pull -gets any new files or changes and updates your directory
	   should do before starting to work.

$git status -shows current files that are not in the repo amongst other things

$git add <file name here> - must be followed by a commit and push.

The two below must be done together
$git commit -m "your message here"
$git push -pushes commited changes to the repo

If that doesn't work and it says a file is not staged you need to
$git commit <file name here> -m "your message here"
$git push
